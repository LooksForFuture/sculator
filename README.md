# sculator
Sculator is the most useful calculator but it's very small.

If you take a look at the calculators which we use, you always see a keyboard. But why should the calculators have keyboard.<br />
We already have a keyboard and our keyboard has all the symbols which we need. So, I removed the keyboard<br />

And why do our calculators have the limitation of the physical calculators? Why can't we write long equations in our calculators?<br />

And what about variables? Think about a calculator which you can declare variables in it. And also, sculator supports math functions too.<br />
