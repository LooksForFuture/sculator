# sculator

Sculator is the smallest but most useful calculator.
No Keyboard: We already have a keyboard and our keyboard has all the symbols which we need. So, I removed the keyboard<br />

And why do our calculators have the limitation of the physical calculators? Why can't we write long equations in our calculators?<br />

And what about variables? Think about a calculator which you can declare variables in it. And also, sculator supports math functions too.<br />

You can also define your own functions in sculator too. For example x = lambda m:m**2-3. Sculator has been written in python. So it supports python's syntax.<br />
And also, sculator is top most. So, when you are exploring ypur folders or navigating between windows, sculator is still on the top.
